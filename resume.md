#### Summary
With a Sociology background, my first love and the major that sparked my passion and excitement for this area of academics and work, I have found the beauty in studying inequalities, specifically with social class and opportunity, through quantitative data and research analysis.  Geospatial data and technology mapping, coupled with a critical view and understanding of society and class discrepancies, allows meaningful change to be achieved when mapping and studying how that stratification presents itself in things such as resource distribution and access, election data, population and demographic distribution, environmental occurrences, etc.  This GIS skillset and approach to stratification and inequality through demography and population studies allows the engagement of spatial analysis with addressing social problems through policy proposal.
